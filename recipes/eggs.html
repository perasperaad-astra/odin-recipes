<p>Description: Gordon Ramsay's award-winning scrambled eggs recipe.</p>
<ul><h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Chives</li>
    <li>Sour cream</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>
<ol><h2>Steps:</h2>
    <li>
        START EGGS: Crack 6 eggs into a deep saucepan or nonstick skillet (cast-iron is fine). Add 1 tablespoon butter. Turn heat on stove to medium-high heat. Start stirring the eggs with a rubber spatula (not a whisk).
    </li>
    <li>3-MINUTE COOK: In about a minute, while stirring continuously, the eggs will start forming curls. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan as you go. Remove pan from heat for 10 seconds. Keep stirring. Place pan back on heat for 30 seconds. Keep stirring. Repeat – off heat 10 seconds, on heat 30 seconds – until eggs are almost cooked.
        <p>Cook for a total of 3 minutes or a few extra seconds if you like your eggs more done. Don't overcook. (You may need a bit less time with fewer eggs and more time with more eggs). Remove pan from heat. Eggs will still look slightly wet, but they will finish cooking in the pan off the heat.</p>
    </li>
    <li>FINISH: Add chives, sour cream (if using) and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Slide eggs onto toast if you like and serve. Garnish with extra chives.</li>
</ol>
